# CORS Component

The CORS is a componente that allows cross-domain communication from the browser. The modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Internet Explorer 10 use the XmlHttpRequest2 object. IE8+ uses the similar XDomainRequest object, which works in the same way as its XmlHttpRequest.

It's cross-broswer compatible:
- Chrome 3+
- Firefox 3.5+
- Opera 12+
- Safari 4+
- Internet Explorer 8+

See the complete list of supported browsers at http://caniuse.com/cors

## Installation

	$ component install pazguille/CORS

See: [https://github.com/component/component](https://github.com/component/component)

## How-to
```js
cors.get({
	'url': 'http://api.site.com/search?query=ps3',
	'credentials': true,
	'success': function (data) {
		// Code here!
	},
	'error': function () {
		// Code here!
	}
});
```

## API
### cors#get(options)
### cors#post(options)
### cors#head(options)
### cors#put(options)
### cors#delete(options)
(All these methods return the `XMLHttpRequest` or `XDomainRequest` object).

### Options
- url: A string containing the URL to which the request is sent.
- params: A map of key-value pairs to set data which will be send.
- success: A function to be called if the request succeeds.
- error: A function to be called if the request fails.
- credentials: Standard CORS requests don't send or set cookies by default. In order to include cookies as part of the request, you need to set the `withCredentials` property to `true`.
- headers: A map of key-value pairs which contains headers that are included in the request.

### Using the shorthand alternative
```js
cors.get('http://api.site.com/search?query=ps3', function (data) {
	// Code here!
});
```
You can use this syntax with the following methods:
- cors#get(url, success)
- cors#post(url, success)
- cors#head(url, success)
- cors#put(url, success)
- cors#delete(url, success)
